# Running Coach — AI Personal Trainer

A personal training dashboard powered by **Garmin Connect** data via the Garmin Connect MCP. The app shows today's health snapshot (steps, body battery, HRV-based stress, training readiness), your last activity, and AI-driven training recommendations — all sourced live from your Garmin account.

## How it works

```
Garmin Connect MCP (stdio)
        |
        v
  garmin-bridge.js  (Express, port 3333)
        |
        v
   index.html + app.js  (static, port 5173)
```

The bridge spawns the Garmin MCP as a child process, communicates with it over JSON-RPC 2.0 (stdin/stdout), and exposes a small REST API that the front-end fetches.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your Garmin Connect credentials:

```
GARMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=<your-garmin-password>
BRIDGE_PORT=3333
```

> Your credentials are only used locally to authenticate the Garmin MCP process. They are never committed to version control (`.env` is in `.gitignore`).

### 3. Run

**Two separate terminals:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the bridge
npm run bridge

# Terminal 2 — serve the front-end
npm run serve
```

**Or, all-in-one with concurrently:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Bridge API

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Bridge liveness check |
| `GET /api/summary` | Today's steps, resting HR, body battery, stress, training readiness |
| `GET /api/last-activity` | Most recent Garmin activity |
| `GET /api/activities` | Last 10 activities |
| `GET /api/recommendations` | Rule-based training recommendations from readiness / HRV / body battery |

## Notes

- The MCP process is restarted automatically if it crashes.
- All bridge calls have a 20-second timeout; the UI falls back gracefully to zeros / empty states if the bridge is unavailable.
- **Strava MCP support** is planned once Strava MCP rollout access is granted. The `config/strava-mcp.config.json` file is kept as a reference for that integration.
